# Fields
Fields are arguably the core of a form, providing users the means to input actual content into a form. With Formie's form builder interface, fields are organised into rows. Each row can have multiple fields (up to 4), allowing fields to be shown in a column layout, side-by-side.

Each field varies by its type, allowing for different functionality and behaviour depending on the field.

Looking for custom fields? Developers can create their own custom fields to extend the functionality of Formie. Read the [Custom Field](docs:developers/custom-field) docs for more.
:::

## Settings
All fields have a standard collection of settings.

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
Label | The label that describes this field.
Handle | How you’ll refer to this field in your templates.
Required | Whether this field should be required when filling out the form.
Error Message | When validating the form, show this message if an error occurs.
Label Position | How the label for the field should be positioned.
Instructions | Instructions to guide the user when filling out this form.
Instructions Position | How the instructions for the field should be positioned.
CSS Classes | Add classes to be outputted on this field’s container.
Container Attributes | Add attributes to be outputted on this field’s container.
Input Attributes | Add attributes to be outputted on this field’s input.
Visibility | See below.

### Visibility
You can set any field to be "Hidden" on the front-end. This will still be available in the source of the page, but hidden for general users. You can also set it to be "Disabled", where the field is never rendered on the front-end, but can still have its value set via [Field Population](docs:template-guides/populating-forms). This can be beneficial if you're concerned with tampering of the HTML before submission.

See the full [Field](docs:developers/field) documentation for more.

In addition, some fields have some additional specific settings, described below.

### Match Field
For some fields (Text, Number, Password and Email) you can select whether to enforce validation where two fields need to have the same value. This is most commonly used for "confirm" fields, such as Email, or Password.




## Field Types
Formie provides 31 different fields for use in your forms.



### Address
A field for addresses. There are a number of sub-fields that can be enabled as required:

- Address 1
- Address 2
- Address 3
- City
- State / Province
- ZIP / Postcode
- Country

If you have any [Address Providers](docs:feature-tour/integrations#address-providers) configured, you can also enable an *Auto-Complete* setting. This allows the use of a single text input to type an address, and have it auto-completed.


### Agree
A field for a single checkbox. Its ideal purpose is to be an agreement checkbox for terms & conditions, or similar. It can be marked as required or not as well as have its checked and unchecked values set.

The description for the Agree field can also contain HTML via a WYSIWYG editor. You can control the available buttons and formatting via [available buttons](docs:get-started/configuration#available-buttons).

#### Settings
Setting | Description
--- | ---
Description | The description for the field. This will be shown next to the checkbox.
Checked Value | The value of this field when it is checked.

### Calculations
A field for creating read-only content based on other fields' content. Supports arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, logic, string, array, numeric and ternary operators, and of course being able to reference other fields.

## Predefined Field Options
For Dropdown, Checkboxes and Radio Buttons, Formie provides a collection of preset options for common scenarios for you to pick from. This might be useful to quickly populate an entire Dropdown with a list of countries, states, languages, currencies and lots more.

You can also select what content to use for the Label and Value of each option. For instance, you might like to label the option as Australia, but have the value as the abbreviated "AU".

The below is a list of options Formie provides by default.
